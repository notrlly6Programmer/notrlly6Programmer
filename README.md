<h1>HI there, I am notrlly6!‚úåÔ∏è</h1>
<h2>I am a Fullstack developer, currently still learning. I develope in HTML, CSS and Javascript is what am learning right now, I do Web-Development as a Hobby and Interest, and since going in the 9th Grade, my dream is to land a Job in Web-Development.(^///^)</h2>

<h1>How I came into Web-DevelopmentüòÅüôå</h1>
<br><br>

<h4>I come from Eastern-Europe and live in Middle Europe near Switzerland and Germany Basel I would say, and I started coding like in January. MY interest was Cybersecurity, however to get in Cyber-sec I had to do one of the two Carrers, as a Application developer or Web-Developer, and I started off just with no interest whatsoever, but then I actually started to get really interested  in Web-Development. I never knew it would be this much Fun learning new Languages and using them to make a Website in my Interest. SO I started locking in and had my first personal Project of a website It went well, nothing crazy just a Basic website with html and css. Which actually made me even more interested in IT and Programming and thanks to the Knownledge of Web-Development, I actually started to understand the "Hard Stuff" which were the Basic stuff in Cyber-sec, just a little Info about my Interest in Cybersec, I like doing stuff with the Flipper Zero I have, Radio Frequiences, Evil Twin Attacks, Bruteforce, BAD USB, BAD KB, RF-Jammer just to test if I have any weak spots in my Home Network and demonstrate real attacks and study them myself to better secure them.</h4>


<p>am a little Introverted but am happy to talk. If you are a Fullstack developer too, then maybe we can exchange Ideas =.=</p>

<h3>My Twitter is @SHAD0W2402 and I post sometimes not reguarlly since am very busy coding but am happy to share any content and connect with other Developers:P</h3>
