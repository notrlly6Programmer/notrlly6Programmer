<h2>I am a Fullstack developer, currently still learning. I develope in HTML, CSS and Javascript is what am learning right now, I do Web-Development as a Hobby and Interest, and since going in the 9th Grade, my dream is to land a Job in Web-Development.(^///^)</h2>

<h1>How I came into Web-DevelopmentüòÅüôå</h1>
<br><br>

<h4>I started off with nothing, I didnt know about VSCODE or anything like that. So I started to look into some youtube videos and started off with python. It was a really fun experience and I programmed a snake game and a Calculator from the guys Video. And that just made me more Interested in Programming. So I started learning HTML and CSS but had trouble and I wasn't getting any progress, I was starting to give up until I got introducen by an Online School, Shkolla Digitajle. A School located in Kosovo I could go there online and Physically. Thanks to my Awesome professor I learned a lot to programm and I even build Web Projects my own to increase my Skills even more!!<br> Till this day am still learning Programming. </h4>
<h2>Fun fact: everything is Written with HTML Elements :) </h2>
